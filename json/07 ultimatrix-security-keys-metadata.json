    "description": "The Ultimatrix Security Keys are two special keys used to give access to otherwise locked DNA of certain aliens in the Ultimatrix. In order to prevent himself, and by extension, Albedo, from becoming certain transformations like Alien X, Ben had their DNA locked and the keys created to return access to him in case of an emergency. Ben gave the keys to Gwen and Kevin.",
